AudioEffectBandLimitFilter
==========================

**Inherits:** :ref:`AudioEffectFilter<class_AudioEffectFilter>` **<** :ref:`AudioEffect<class_AudioEffect>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Adds a band-limit filter to an audio bus.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A "band-limit" filter attenuates the frequencies at :ref:`AudioEffectFilter.cutoff_hz<class_AudioEffectFilter_property_cutoff_hz>`, and allows frequencies outside the frequency threshold to pass unchanged. It is a wider and weaker version of :ref:`AudioEffectNotchFilter<class_AudioEffectNotchFilter>`, and is the opposite of :ref:`AudioEffectBandPassFilter<class_AudioEffectBandPassFilter>`.

This filter can be used to give more room for other sounds to play at that frequency.
